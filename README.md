# react-console-colors
Adding colors to console.logs inside browser inspector.
=========

I made this because I wanted to make it easier for finding my console logs in the browser, without having to user a bunch of random text symbols. I feel like this is a cleaner approach.

## Installation

  `npm install react-console-colors`

## Usage

    require('react-console-colors');

    console.cyan('your text here');



FYI: For NodeJS color output you can find a much better package called 'colors'
